There appears to be a bug in the standard JDK that can prevent the Mac menu bar from functioning. This only affects a debuggable version of IntelliJ or Android Studio launched from IntelliJ. Commands invoked from the menu bar do nothing, although the same command invoked via a key binding works as expected.

There are two work-arounds. The simplest is to edit the run config used to launch the product under test. In the **VM options**, change `-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true` to `-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=false`. That puts the menu bar in the window, rather than at the top of the screen.

The other solution is to use a different JDK. Jetbrains has one that can be used. Clone it from [https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u](https://github.com/JetBrains/jdk8u). Or you can use the JRE distributed with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. It is in the application installation folder: `<intellij>/Contents/JDK/Contents/Home/jre`. You'll need to copy `tools.jar` from `.../Home/lib` into `.../Home/jre/lib`. You also need to edit the run config to disable the JRE check. In **VM options** change _-Didea.jre.check=true_ to _-Didea.jre.check=false_. To make the run config use the alternate JDK edit it and change **JRE** to point to the new location. It will be something like _/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA.app/Contents/jdk/Contents/Home/jre_ or where ever you downloaded the github repo.
